# Resources-4-Life
A list of resources that might enrich a life.

This project was more practice than anything else, just a simple little something I cooked up in my code laboratory to reinforce what I've been learning on Treehouse and other code-teaching resources.  I think the end result actually looks pretty sharp, and the items I've gathered together here in this stylish list really could do some good for those in need of such things.
